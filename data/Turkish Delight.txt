TURKISH DELIGHT


#1 Cosmic Dust

You - a speck of cosmic dust in this vast universe 

How can  you hold the power to speed up time so much? 

So tell me, will you love me till the last tick of humanly recorded time? 

************

#2 Effortless

Loving you is effortless

I love you from the depths of my soul 

From the inner corners of my heart 

With every bit of warm breathe in my lungs 

Without you, home is not home 

And I am not me. 

Like shards of broken glass, 

Without you 

You will find me in pieces.

#3 Batu’s hazel eyes  - Duplex Style Poem

Feels like the sun itself painted your eyes 

I hear rhymes and melodies when you stare   

The very melody of life sung by your eyes 

I am lost in the void of your hazel hue 

I get lost in the depths of your hazel hue 

With blended specks of green and golden too.

A beautiful chaos of green and golden tones.

An entire galaxy seems to live within you.

A vast galactic starry night revolving within you

Beneath dark blonde lashes, your eyes gaze so deeply. 

Your hazel eyes gaze deeply, looks at me intimately.

I wonder if our souls entangled through stardust before

Before the moon formed to create waves across shores  

Before the sun itself took its time to paint your eyes greenish gold.

#4 The universe in you -- Inspired by Lang Leav

Feels like I was sent just for you 

To follow you across lifetimes 

Across millennia 

And If you were to reappear before me 

Across multiverses 

Reincarnated 

Through every end and recreation for the universe
 
I would always choose to love you 

************


#5 Early Mornings - hope you are online at 4 am 

I don’t wake up at 5 am 

just to listen to the birds 

But in hope that I might find you 

awake  too 

on the other side of the world 

************


#6 Address to your heart 

Tell me your address
 
The road to your soul 

I would ride waves across 

To meet you on any shore 

The mind of yours 

That’s ocean deep 

Your thoughts fill up my mind

I would  hold your hand 

and follow the dark 

Leaving all the light behind 

************


#7 Random 

How do I explain the color blue to 

someone who has never seen it ?

Or the feeling of a sea breeze to

someone who  never felt it ?

And just like that it is impossible 

To compose verses of my love 

When you leave me depleted of words 

unconsolidated 

these rhythms of the heart 

That echoes of us

Through time and time 

The more I want to say 

the more I can’t convey 

You left me me lost in this

Inexplicable loop of eternal love. 

************


#8 My First Poem to You 

And my wish is that, you are in my life 

Not just for a season 

But for all the seasons I m yet to see 

Through all the falls, winters, springs, summers 

and all that in between 

That our love doesn’t wither like 

Fall’s dying leaves 

That our love stays evergreen
